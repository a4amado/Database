## what is a transaction ?  
A Transaction is  a collection of queries that are treated as one unit.

## What is Atomicity ?
All queries in a transaction must succeed. If one query fails, all prior successful queries in the transaction
should rollback. If the database went down prior to a commit of a transaction,
all the successful queries in the transactions should rollback  

## Isolation
### Read uncomitted: any transaction can read uncomitted writes of any other transaction
### Read comitted: transaction can read ONLY comitted writes of any other transaction
### Repeatable reads: poses a lock on a recorded until the the transaction is comitted.
